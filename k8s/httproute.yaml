# NOTE: This file is NOT applied when using rawConfig with internal binds.
# The rawConfig in AgentgatewayParameters (agentgateway-params.yaml) already defines
# routes for /health and / paths. Using this HTTPRoute with rawConfig would create
# a routing loop since backendRefs point to the same proxy service.
#
# This file is kept for reference if you switch to Gateway API-native routing
# (without rawConfig binds).
